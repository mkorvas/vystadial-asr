Summary
-------
* This KALDI recipe is based on Voxforge KALDI recipe 
  http://vpanayotov.blogspot.cz/2012/07/voxforge-scripts-for-kaldi.html.
* Requires KALDI installation and Linux environment. (Tested on Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04 and 12.10.)
* Recipes deployed with the Kaldi toolkit are located at
  ``$KALDI_ROOT/egs/name_of_recipe/s[1-5]/``.  
  This recipe requires to set up ``$KALDI_ROOT`` variable 
  so it can use Kaldi binaries and scripts from  ``$KALDI_ROOT/egs/wsj/s5/``.


Details
-------
* Our scripts prepare the data to the expected format to ``data`` directory.
* Experiment files are stored to ``exp`` directory.
* The symbolic links to ``$KALDI_ROOT/wsj/s5/utils`` and ``$KALDI_ROOT/wsj/s5/steps`` are automatically created.
* The ``local`` directory contains scripts for data preparation.
* The files ``path.sh``, ``cmd.sh`` and  ``conf/*`` 
  contain configurations for the recipe.
* Language model (LM) is either built from the training data using 
  `SRILM <www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/>`_  or we supply one in 
  the ARPA format.


Running experiments
-------------------
Before running the experiments, check that:

* you have the Kaldi toolkit compiled: 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/kaldi/.
* you have IRSTLM compiled. (This is needed for building a language model 
  unless you supply your own LM in the ARPA format.) See 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/irstlm/.
* the ``run.sh`` script will see the Kaldi scripts and binaries.
  Check for example that ``$KALDI_ROOT/egs/wsj/s5/utils/parse_options.sh`` is valid path. 
* links in the ``conf`` directory point to the right data and that the 
  setup fits your needs.
* in ``cmd.sh``, you switched to run the training on a SGE[*] grid if 
  required (disabled by default) and 
  ``njobs`` is less than number of your CPU cores.

Start the recipe by running ``bash run.sh``.
It will create ``mfcc``, ``data`` and ``exp`` directories.
If any of them exists, it will ask you if you want them to be overwritten.
After running the experiments, the ``exp`` directory will be backed up to 
the ``Results`` directory.

Extracting the results and trained models
-----------------------------------------
The main script, ``run.sh``, performs not only training of the acoustic 
models, but also decoding.
The acoustic models are evaluated during running the scripts and evaluation 
reports are printed to the standard output.

The ``local/results.py exp`` command extracts the results from the ``exp`` directory.
It is invoked at the end of the ``run.sh`` script and the results are 
thereby stored to ``exp/results.log``.

If you want to use the trained acoustic model outside the prepared script,
you need to build the ``HCLG`` decoding graph yourself.  (See 
http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/graph.html for general introduction to the FST 
framework in Kaldi.)

The simplest way to start with decoding is to use the same LM which
was used by the ``run.sh`` script.  Let's say you want to decode with 
the acoustic model stored in ``exp/tri1``.
Then you need just 3 files:

----

============================  ============================================================================
``exp/tri1/graph/HCLG.fst``   # decoding graph
``exp/tri1/graph/words.txt``  # Word symbol table, a mapping between words and integers which are decoded.
``exp/tri1/final.mdl``        # trained acoustic model 
============================  ============================================================================

----

The ``HCLG.fst`` decoding graph is created by ``utils/mkgraph.sh``, see ``run.sh`` for details.
